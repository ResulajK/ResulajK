# Hi there, I'm Klevis Resulaj! 👋 Welcome to my corner of the web.

I'm a passionate tech enthusiast, a perpetual tinkerer, and a web developer who finds joy in building things from the ground up. My curiosity doesn't stop at the code editor; it extends to the bare metal in my homelab, where I experiment with infrastructure and self-hosting. I'm driven by the challenge of solving problems and the thrill of seeing an idea come to life.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

* 💻 **Building Web Apps:** I spend most of my time architecting and creating full-stack web applications. I love the entire process, from designing a responsive front-end to building a robust back-end.

* 🏠 **Running My Homelab:** My personal server rack is my playground! I'm constantly experimenting with self-hosting open-source services, setting up virtual machines, and learning the ins and outs of networking and system administration. It's the perfect environment to test new technologies in a real-world setting.

* 🔧 **Tinkering with Tech:** Whether it's a new piece of hardware, a promising open-source project, or a complex configuration, I love to dive in, take it apart (figuratively and sometimes literally!), and understand how it works.

* 🌱 **Always Learning:** The tech world moves fast, and I'm running right along with it! I'm on a continuous journey to expand my skill set and deepen my understanding of modern development practices.
